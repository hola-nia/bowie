<p class="bowie-paragraph">We're lovers, and that is a fact. Is it any wonder I reject you first? We're learning to live with somebody's depression. It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect. See these eyes so green? Sordid details following. Have you sought fortune evasive and shy? </p>

<p>I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners. Don't you wonder sometimes, 'bout sound and vision? Yes we're lovers, and that is that. If you think we're gonna make it, you better hang on to yourself. I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk. Sordid details following. Somewhere, someone's calling me when the chips are down. </p>

<p>I'm an alligator. I've got more friends than I've had hot dinners. Far out! He talks like a jerk but he could eat you with a fork and spoon. We believe in you. No death for the perfect men. I'm afraid of Americans. His name was always Buddy, and he'd shrug and ask to stay. </p>

<p>Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever. Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel. The return of the Thin White Duke. Turn to the right! He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue, what a jolly boring thing to do. If she says she can do it, then she can do it, she don't make false claims. I'm floating in a most peculiar way. It's the terror of knowing what this world is about â€” watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!". </p>

<p>Don't let me hear you say life's taking you nowhere, angel. He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue, what a jolly boring thing to do. If you want it, boys, get it here. It's a very modern world, but nobody's perfect. I found my teacher crouching in his overalls. It's a moving world, but that's no reason to shoot some of those missiles. I never thought I'd need so many people. </p>

<p>I'm afraid of Americans. I found my teacher crouching in his overalls. Turn to the left! He laughed at accidental sirens that broke the evening gloom. Don't you wonder sometimes, 'bout sound and vision? Look at those cavemen go. Listen. The far side of town, where the thin men stalk the streets while the sane stay underground. </p>

<p>As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent, you asked for the latest party. I'm glad that you're older than me. Listen. Somewhere, someone's calling me when the chips are down. It's a moving world, but that's no reason to shoot some of those missiles. The far side of town, where the thin men stalk the streets while the sane stay underground. Freak out! </p>
